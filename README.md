Internal Sensor Paramter Learning package for ROS

Created Spring 2017 for Algorithmic Robotics class at Case Western Reserve University by Trent Ziemer.

A ROS implementation of an algorithm called learn_intrinsic_parameters from Thrun et al's "Probabilistic Robotics" textbook. 
Thank you to those who helped me design this project, and to them for providing the entire theory of operation to make this research a reality.

More documentation included throughout.
